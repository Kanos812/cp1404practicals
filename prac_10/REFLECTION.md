# CP1404 Practical Reflection - Harrison O'Kane 


## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My accuracy fluctuated when I did remember to utilise estimations in my programming. At the start,
I was quite hit-and-miss in being able to estimate the completed time necessary for a specific tasks.
I don't think there was a single trend as there was a decent proportion of both types of estimates, either too short or
too. However, what I did notice was greater consistency and accuracy in my estimates as I gained better understanding 
of structuring my code, allowing to make much more rational assumptions rather than generalised guesses like at the start. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
For the first practicals where I used estimates, I found I was wildly inconsistent in 
creating an estimate that was achievable. However, as I began getting a greater understanding 
of design thinking and good software practices, I found my estimates were much closer to the 
actual completion time. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I learned that if done correctly, estimates provide guidelines for completing a task in an acceptable amount of time. 
This allows for better planning and time management. Additionally, practicing estimation helped me identify potential challenges early on, 
making it easier to allocate adequate time and resources to different parts of a project.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
I learned that a recurring issue was that I would stray off-topic from the taught content and make presumptions, 
which often led to inconsistent and inefficient code. Receiving feedback from others highlighted areas where I could 
improve my code's readability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices. It also made me more aware of the importance of 
writing clear and maintainable code, particularly in the context of collaboration and feedback loops. 

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
Reviewing other people's code gave me a broader perspective on different coding styles and problem-solving approaches. 
It enhanced my ability to identify potential issues and improvements in code, and it helped me understand the rationale 
behind certain design decisions. This practice also improved my critical thinking and communication skills, as I needed 
to provide feedback that was constructive and meaningful. 

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 06 Feedback Request - scott-gills-dyer](https://github.com/scott-gills-dyer/cp1404practicals/pull/1)

### Explanation

I put time to go through each file and provide not only feedback on the provided files, but also examples to help the user 
understand my thoughts. Although I provided a lot of constructive criticism, I also made the effort to balance this out with 
positive affirmations on producing good quality good.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 08 Feedback Request - nicknlowe](https://github.com/nicknlowe/cp1404practicals/pull/6)

### Explanation

Although this code was completed to a high degree, I was able to provide constructive feedback through highlighting 
examples of inconsistencies in code (for instance in variable naming). I believe that I was able to provide constructive 
criticism that allowed the user to further enhance their coding habits for future by summarising my suggestions in a comment 
at the end. Furthermore, I made sure to praise the user for the high quality code that they were able to produce. 

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
If I were in charge of the subject, I would incorporate more real-world scenarios and projects that require students 
to apply the concepts they've learned in a practical context. This would help bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and 
practical application, and make practicals more engaging. Additionally, I would include more collaborative tasks 
to encourage teamwork and peer learning. That being said I really enjoyed the practicals given to us this year. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
Although I was inconsistent in applying knowledge learned in class, I was successful in completing every practical
(apart from the project management system in week 7) to a degree that fulfilled the criteria and worked with little debugging 
required. I believe I was successful in being able to map my completion from initial planning to the final solution, albeit 
I can improve my efficiency of the process by being more mindful of good coding practices.
