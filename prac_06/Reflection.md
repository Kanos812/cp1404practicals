# CP1404 Practical Reflection


## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
While I have previous experience in Python, this subject has allowed me to develop and build code in a more structured, meaningful and organised way to save me time and effort.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
None so far - across all my Engineering & IT subjects this has been the most fun and rewarding. I guess I would like to see more practical work externally as part of the IT degree but I assume this is covered more in later years
