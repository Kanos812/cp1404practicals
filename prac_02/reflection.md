0% - I have previous knowledge of programming and have read through the powerpoints. However I am going to catch up on
the lecture recordings (which I have missed due to external factors) 

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

No plan yet - need to create a timetable to catch up

I am getting involved with the practical coding aspects and I enjoy writing scripts and functions. I feel I understand Python quite well

I need to start collecting notes and practicing my theory for programming as I am relying too much on previous experience

Need to look more at my indenting and my syntax. Also need to get into habit of using psuedocode and planning script rather than 
going all in
